#Overview
C++ Rhythm game using embedded software designed to run on an Arduino.
Note timings are compiled directly into the software and uploaded to the microcontroller to avoid usage of extra memory components; however this is limiting in terms of # of notes allowed and thus song length.

#Requirements
1x 8x8 RGB LED matrix
1x Arduino Uno R3
2x Joysticks
1x 4-digit 7 segment display
1x MP3 player module
